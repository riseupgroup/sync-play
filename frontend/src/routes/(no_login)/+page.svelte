        Auth Server

        This Example uses RiseUpGroup's Auth Server to authenticate users. The Auth Server is not
        just a simple OAuth2 server, it is a full-featured Identity and Access Management server
        that can be used to manage users and groups. In fact it doesn't even use OAuth2 to log you
        into a service like this example website.
