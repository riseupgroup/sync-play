        </h2>
        <p class="sm:text-lg">
            Each user loads the same video file from their local system. Once you‚Äôre in a room,
            our WebSocket-based sync logic takes over: play, pause, seek ‚Äì everything stays
            aligned. No video or audio ever leaves your computer.

                Whether it‚Äôs pausing, seeking, or adjusting speed ‚Äì our smart sync logic keeps

            Why we built this üõ†Ô∏è
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 sm:text-xl">
            Not everyone has the bandwidth ‚Äì literally ‚Äì to host and stream movies from home.
            Maybe your upload speed is too slow, or setting up a media server like Jellyfin ends
            in endless buffering and out-of-sync frustration.
        </p>
        <p class="sm:text-xl">
            We built this tool because we just wanted to hit play and watch together ‚Äì without
            the technical drama. No server setup. No transcoding delays. No rebuffering after
            every pause. Everyone uses their own copy of the movie, locally. Our tool just keeps
            your players in sync, using lightweight WebSocket communication. Simple. Fast.
            Reliable. You don‚Äôt need to stream when you already have the file.
